             <li>8 chicken cutlets or 4 chicken breasts sliced in half (about 1.5 lbs)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 c. flour, for dredging</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. canola oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/3 c. diced onion (about 1/2 small onion)</li>
            <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 c. dry Marsala wine</li>
            <li>3/4 c. chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 c. heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a sturdy cup, pound chicken until about 1/4 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour. Add canola oil to medium sauté pan over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, cook chicken in batches until browned, 2 minutes per side. Set chicken aside and tent to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour off excess oil, then melt butter in pan over medium heat. Sauté mushroom and onions until soft, about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 2-3 minutes more. Add wine, broth, cream, and thyme, and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Plate chicken and serve with sauce on top, garnished with a little more fresh thyme.</li>
